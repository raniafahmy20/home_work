//Explanation Tasks (Write short answers):
//2. Describe the difference between var, dynamic, and explicitly typed variables in Dart. 

/*
var is keyword can replace by datatype of value.
when declare and assign in same line if i declare in line then 
assign in another line var is turns into dynamic.

dynamic is weak datatype can assign any value and
 i can change it to value of another datatype.  

explicity is mean datatype is determine when declare variable.
I write datatype directly then i can't change it
double,bool,int,list
ex double s=3.5;

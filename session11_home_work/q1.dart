/* Q1
 Design an OOP model for planning trip fuel across multiple vehicle types.
 Requirements:- Provide a general vehicle type with encapsulated core data
  (private fields) and validated constructors
 (invalid â†’ print an error; keep previous values).
 - Create at least two specialized vehicle types that inherit from the general type
  and introduce one private field each affecting fuel usage, with validation.
 - Define a fuel computation method in the general type;
  specialized types must override it with their own rule.
 - In a mixed collection of vehicles, given a list of trip distances,
  compute total fuel per vehicle and print
 which vehicles cannot complete the route under their own constraints 
 (you define the constraint per
 type).
